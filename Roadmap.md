=======
The following is a list of tasks/features not yet implemented
that I would like to get done as part of this project.


  * Core backend API server.
  * Metrics about requests served.
  * Generate Auth proxy configuration (oauth2).
  * Start Auth proxy to authenticate requests.
  * Re-write portal UI to be server-side rendered.
  * Have the proxy serve WebUI statics.
  * Write documentation.
  * Validate configuration.
  * Rewrite backend in Go/Rust?
  * Support different HTTP(S) proxies? (needs to support auth_request).
  * Support different Auth proxies?
  * Support multiple Auth proxies (for different login options)?
